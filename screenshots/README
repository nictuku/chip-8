To populate this directory, run the tests inside "system":

$ cd system
$ go test |grep directory
(...)
Screenshots directory: /tmp/<gameA>090859780
(...)
Screenshots directory: /tmp/<gameB>312323213

Those directories will then contain bmp and png files for each game. Make sure
each one look correct for a 100-cycles run, then copy the files here.
