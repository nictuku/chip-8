chip-8
======

A CHIP-8 emulator in Go, in early stages of work, but able to run a few demo ROMs.

The list of partially supported games can be seen in the "screenshots" directory,
but none are particularly interesting yet.

Limitations:
  - does not implement all instructions yet, so not all games run.
  - input hasn't been added yet, so you can't move the paddles in Pong ;-)
  - produces very verbose debugging message.
